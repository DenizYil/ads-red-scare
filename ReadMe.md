# Red Scare
Here is the code implementation for our solution to the **Red Scare** problem.

## Getting the Results

 1. First, ensure you have installed all of the requirements for the project. This can be done by running `pip install -r requirements.txt` from the repository's root. If you do not have pip installed, follow the [Pip Installation Guide](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stcable/installation/#).
 2. Simply run the *read_data.py* file present at the repository's root. This can be done by running `python read_data.py` or `python3 read_data.py` depending on your OS.
 3. Please wait as the script runs our solutions on the various example graphs. This can take a while. When it is done, it will generate a new file: *results.txt* with all of the used data, and the results gotten by the various algorithms.
