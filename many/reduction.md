### Claim: **Many** is NP-hard.

**Proof**: We will reduce from **Longest Path**, which is known to be NP-hard.

Let \( G = (V, E) \) and \( k \) be an instance of the **Longest Path** problem. Here:
- \( G \) is a directed acyclic graph (DAG) with vertex set \( V(G) \) and edge set \( E(G) \).

Construct an instance of **Many** as follows:
- Use the same graph \( G \) with \( V(G) \) and \( E(G) \).
- Mark all vertices in \( V(G) \) as red.
- Set \( s \) as the source vertex and \( t \) as the target vertex.
- The **Many** problem now asks for the maximum number of red vertices on any \( s,t \)-path in \( G \).

For instance, if \( G \) has the following structure:

\[
\text{Vertices: } V = \{s, A, B, C, t\} \\
\text{Edges: } E = \{(s, A), (A, B), (A, C), (C, t)\}
\]

Then the corresponding **Many** instance is the same graph, with all vertices marked as red. The task is to compute the maximum number of red vertices on any path from \( s \) to \( t \).

**If there is a solution to the Many instance**:
Let \( p \) be an \( s,t \)-path in \( G \) with the maximum number of red vertices.
Since all vertices in \( V(G) \) are red, the number of red vertices on \( p \) is simply the total number of vertices in \( p \).
If \( p \) has \( k+1 \) vertices, then the corresponding path in the original **Longest Path** instance has \( k \) edges. Thus, a solution to **Many** implies a solution to **Longest Path**.

**If there is a solution to the Longest Path instance**:
Suppose \( G \) contains a path with \( k \) or more edges. This path contains \( k+1 \) vertices.
The corresponding path in the **Many** instance will have \( k+1 \) red vertices. Hence, a solution to **Longest Path** implies a solution to **Many**.

#### Example
Consider the **Longest Path** instance \( G \):
![Graph Example](./longest_path_many_reduction.png)
- \( V = \{s, A, B, C, t\} \),
- \( E = \{(s, A), (A, B), (A, C), (C, t)\} \),
- \( k = 2 \).

The corresponding **Many** instance will result in the same graph \( G \) with all vertices red.

For \( k = 2 \), the **Longest Path** solution is \( s \to A \to C \to t \) (2 edges, 3 vertices).
For the **Many** instance, the path \( s \to A \to C \to t \) has 3 red vertices, which is the maximum.

#### Conclusion
Since we have reduced **Longest Path** to **Many** in polynomial time, and the solutions correspond exactly, **Many** is NP-hard.
